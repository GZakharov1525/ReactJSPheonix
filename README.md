This is a WIP currently, the project was started as a way to actively learn ReactJS (a front-end javascript framework) as well as learn and utilize Python Flask (a back-end framework).

Currently working on the front-end by learning and utilizing the component system that React offers, once the basic functionality of the website is functional I will move on to working with the back-end. After back-end work I will move forward with hosting and server-side work, likely with NGINX, and attempt to host on a cloud based platform such as AWS. Following these steps I will return to add more pages & functionality to the web site.
